### Step 6
#### Summary
 As acused, Palmoria Company is gender bias and patriachy. This is drawn from the inference that there are more male in all department than females. There are more male in all regions   as well. In addition, male received more salary than female in all departments and regions. Also, fewer female recieve above $100000 compared to their male counterpart. it was also drawn rom the report than more male recieved salary higher than the minimum wage. However, the gap in female to male employee is very minimal and can be adjusted with little cost. 
 The productivity of the female employees was higher than that of the male employees. This was drawn from the inference that the ratings for females were higher than that of male in "good" and "Very good" ratings. The male can be deduced to be low as their ratings were higher in poor and very poor and average performance. 
 After the bonus was added, some department total salry increases while some reduced. This imply that department like Training performed very well, since their bonuses were high, thus the increament in the total salary. however, department like Accounting may have low rating, this is because their total salary decreased after bonus.  
#### Conclusion
In conclusion, Palmoria company is advised based on the findings of this report to increase the number of female employees that will recruited in the company. Highy Productive female employee should be promoted or compensated.
